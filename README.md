North Americans would get a huge boost in self-esteem if they could just wear a #mask to help others instead of just thinking about themselves.

#Masks just might actually help you in reducing your #covid19 risk and not just help others!

The Rt (local Virus Reproduction Rate) needs to be better understood and graphed for the average person to understand and react to locally. 
(An Rt of 1 or greater means the virus is moving exponentially, Less than one means the virus might be reducing)

# Driving Risk Reduction Verses Covid 19 Risk Reduction Comparison Table


| Driving Risk Reduction | Covid 19 Risk Reduction |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Before Leaving Your House**      |        **Before Leaving Your House**  |
| Check that your cars mirrors are adjusted properly for you     |     Check that you have a **clean homemade cloth mask** with you. This is the first and most important rule. |

| **General Driving Risk Reduction**    |    **General Covid Risk Reduction**  |
|  Mirror and Shoulder Check           |    Wear a mask when:  In small rooms with low ceilings and other people, when within 2 m of anyone anywhere who does not live with you, when people are up-wind of you, when travelling with anyone, when it's the law             |
|  Drive Defensively, think what could happen next           |  Mask defensively, think about what are the biggest risks. Note: alone in your car, or outside by yourself are very very low risk.            |
|   Anticipate          |        Anticipate            |
|  The speedlimit saves lives           |  Outside has enormous air dilution effect. Try to stay outside, away from people, upwind            |
|  If you see someone driving erratically, try to get behind them and even farther awayu. Call 911 if appropriate.           |  If you see someone coughing, be distance, airflow and mask aware. You can always use your shirt as an impromtu mask, by just pulling it up. Reminder first Rule, always have your mask with you.            |
|   Reduce music volume if things start getting tricky. Hard to think with the music blasting          |              |
|  Slow down for any kind of road work           |     Respiratory Droplets that are affected by gravity contain a lot more active virus than aerosols that can float in a room for many hours. Be aware of your time in small rooms or close to others.         |
|  Do not looky loo at accidents as you could cause another accident.            |    Stay away from sick people, unless you have the proper protective equipment that healthcare professionals wear.          |
| Don't drive under the influence of Drugs, Alcohol or any substance that can make you tired            |              |
|  If tired think of perhaps taking a break or having a coffee. A 20 min nap in a safely parked car can often do wonders for your attention.          |              |

| **Residential Driving Risk Reduction**    |    **Covid At Home Risk Reduction**  |
|  The speed limit is the maximum, you can always go slower as you see: pets, children, toys, groups of people etc           |   If someone at home has a cough or a fever: Do your research, listen to your doctor to protect them and the rest of your family. Infected person in room near washroom. Time for everyone to wear a mask, when the infected person is around. Also increased house cleaning (Disinfectant)            |

|  Obey the 2 second rule (Adjust cruise control for 2 second rule)           |    always Social Distance 2 meters (6 feet)          |
| Adjust 2 second rule for the weather conditions: Extra seconds for rain, Night, Snow, Fog, if your tired etc.            |     Airflow aware: adjust 2 m rule as wind increases, Note:masked and immunocompromised people should try to stay up-wind         |
| Know how to merge safely, smoothly get to the same speed as the highway cars            |              |

| **Driving to Work or School**   |    **Covid Risks at Work or School**  |
|  In parking lots drive very slowly, a person, child or car could quickly come out from behind an object.            |   Wear your mask, or have it very close so you can "Mask Up" easily to work closely with someone or navigate around a group of people.           |
