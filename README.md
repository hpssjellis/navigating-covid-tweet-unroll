A letter to your town Mayor suggesting possible guidelines to help with supporting volunter or mandatory homemade mask wearing to reduce the spread of Covid-19



# Dear Mayor

The following are possible guidlines that could help protect our towns elderly population and others from death due to the exponential growth of Covid-19. 


# Guidlines for Homemade Mask Usage during an Epidemic:

1. Stay home as much as you can.

1. Wash you hands before eating or touching your eye, nose, mouth.

1. Social Distance (2 m or 6 feet).

1. Whenever you can't social distance (2 m or 6 feet) with any non-family members either inside or outside please wear a mask or face covering.

1. If you are ever in a room, store, business, vehicle with any non-family members please wear a mask for the duration of your visit or trip.

1. If a family member has a fever or has tested positive for Covid-19 please wear a mask at home and follow the advise of your family doctor.

# Reasons for Wearing Homemade Masks.

1. When a contagious person exhales, talks, coughs or sneezes, virus laden droplets are caught by face coverings. Without face coverings these droplets can evaporate to a much smaller size, these micro-droplets float much farther, and are then much harder to stop even with professional masks. 

1. If a large percentage of people wear homemade masks a virus has less chance of replicating. If a virus can't replicate the pandemic stops.
