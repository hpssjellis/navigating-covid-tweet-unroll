# Dear Mayor

The following are possible guidelines that could help protect our towns elderly population and others from death due to Covid-19. 


# Guidelines for Homemade Mask Usage during a Pandemic:

1. Stay home as much as you can.

1. Wash you hands before eating or touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

1. Always social distance (2 m or 6 feet) with anyone that does not live with you.

1. Before leaving your house check that your homemade mask is adjusted well, fits comfortably and has no leaks. 

1. Whenever you can't social distance (2 m or 6 feet) either inside or outside please wear a mask or face covering.

1. If you are ever in a room, store, business or vehicle with other people that you do not live with, please wear a mask for the duration of the visit or trip.

1. If someone you live with has a fever or has tested positive for Covid-19 please wear a mask at home and follow the advise of your family doctor.

1. Wash and check your homemade mask nightly so it is dry in the morning, best to have 2 or more masks. 



# Reasons for Wearing Homemade Masks.

1. When a contagious person exhales, talks, coughs or sneezes, virus laden droplets are caught by face coverings/mask. Without face coverings/masks these droplets can evaporate to a very small size. These smaller micro-droplets can float farther distances, but more importantly are now much harder to stop even with professional grade masks. A reminder that the professional N95 masks are needed for hospital workers as machinery can aerosol the virus. An aerosol is even smaller than a micro-droplet and is even harder to stop with a mask.

1. If a large percentage of people wear homemade masks the virus has less chance of replicating. If a virus can't replicate the Pandemic stops.
