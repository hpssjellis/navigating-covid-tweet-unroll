A letter to my town Mayor suggesting possible guidelines to help with supporting homemade mask wearing to reduce the spread of Covid-19



# Dear Mayor

The following are possible guidlines that could help protect our towns elderly population and others from death due to the exponential growth of Covid-19. 


# Guidlines for Homemade Mask Usage during an Epidemic:

1. Whenever you can't social distance (2 m or 6 feet) either inside or outside please wear a mask or face covering

1. If you are ever in a room, store, business, vehical with any non-family members please wear a mask for the duration of your visit or trip

# Reasons for Homemade Mask Wearing

1. When a contagious person exhales, talks, coughs or sneezes, virus laden droplets are caught by face coverings. Without face coverings these droplets can evaporate to a much smaller size which are then much harder to stop even with professional masks. 

1. If a large percentage of people wear homemade masks a virus has less chance of replicating. If a virus can't replicate the pandemic stops.
