# Dear Mayor

The following are possible guidelines that could help protect our towns elderly population and others from death due to Covid-19. 


# Guidelines for Homemade Mask Usage during an Epidemic:

1. Stay home as much as you can.

1. Wash you hands before eating or touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

1. Always social distance (2 m or 6 feet) with anyone that does not live with you.

1. Before leaving your house check that your homemade mask is adjusted well, fits comfortably and has no leaks. 

1. Whenever you can't social distance (2 m or 6 feet) either inside or outside please wear a mask or face covering.

1. If you are ever in a room, store, business or vehicle with other people that are not family members, please wear a mask for the duration of the visit or trip.

1. If a family member has a fever or has tested positive for Covid-19 please wear a mask at home and follow the advise of your family doctor.

1. Wash your homemade mask daily, best to have 2 or more masks. 



# Reasons for Wearing Homemade Masks.

1. When a contagious person exhales, talks, coughs or sneezes, virus laden droplets are caught by face coverings. Without face coverings these droplets can evaporate to a much smaller size. These much smaller micro-droplets can float farther distances, but more importantly are now much harder to stop even with professional grade masks. 

1. If a large percentage of people wear homemade masks a virus has less chance of replicating. If a virus can't replicate the Pandemic stops.
