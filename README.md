# Dear Mayor

The following are possible guidelines that could help protect our towns elderly population and others from death due to the exponential growth of Covid-19. 


# Guidelines for Homemade Mask Usage during an Epidemic:

1. Stay home as much as you can.

1. Wash you hands before eating or touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

1. Always Social Distance (2 m or 6 feet) with non-family members

1. Whenever you can't social distance (2 m or 6 feet) with any non-family members either inside or outside please wear a mask or face covering.

1. If you are ever in a room, store, business, vehicle with any non-family members please wear a mask for the duration of the visit or trip.

1. If a family member has a fever or has tested positive for Covid-19 please wear a mask at home and follow the advise of your family doctor.

# Reasons for Wearing Homemade Masks.

1. When a contagious person exhales, talks, coughs or sneezes, virus laden droplets are caught by face coverings. Without face coverings these droplets can evaporate to a much smaller size. These much smaller micro-droplets can float farther distances, but more importantly are now much harder to stop even with professional grade masks. 

1. If a large percentage of people wear homemade masks a virus has less chance of replicating. If a virus can't replicate the Pandemic stops.
