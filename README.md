North Americans would get a huge boost in needed self esteem if they could just wear a #mask to help others instead of just thinking about themselves.

| Leave early           |              |
| Plan (Enter GPS address before driving)            |              |

|  Mirror and Shoulder Check           |    Wear a mask when: In small rooms with low ceilings and other people, when within 2 m of anyone anywhere who does not live with you, when people are up-wind of you, when travelling with anyone, when it's the law             |
|  Drive Defensively, think what could happen next           |  Mask defensively, think about what are the biggest risks. Note: alone in your car, or outside by yourself are very very low risk.            |
|   Anticipate          |        Anticipate            |
|  The speedlimit saves lives           |              |
|  If you see someone driving erratically, try to get behind them and even farther awayu. Call 911 if appropriate.           |  If you see someone coughing, be distance, airflow and mask aware. You can always use your shirt as an impromtu mask, by just pulling it up. Reminder first Rule, always have your mask with you.            |
|   Reduce music volume if things start getting tricky. Hard to think with the music blasting          |              |
|  Slow down for any kind of road work           |              |
|  Do not looky loo.            |              |

|  The speedlimit is the maximum, you can go slower as you see pets, children, toys, groups of people etc           |              |
